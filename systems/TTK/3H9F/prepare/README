Instructions to prepare and parametrize the 3H9F (Mps1-IN-2) 
                   system for simulation
============================================================

Dependencies:
 - AmberTools 20
 - VMD or other molecular viewer
 - QMrebind (v0.5.0 at the time of writing)
 - SEEKR2 (v2.1.6 at this time of writing)
 - SeekrTools


01_Xray:
--------
Directory 01_Xray contains the original Xray crystal structure
as well as some PDB files generated after processing by Maestro:
 - The full system (both ligand and receptor)
 - Just the receptor
 - Just the ligand


02_Param:
---------
Submit a job to PDB2PQR for the PDB structure that contains just
the receptor at the site https://server.poissonboltzmann.org/pdb2pqr
Select AMBER FF and AMBER naming scheme. Download the resulting 
PQR file to 02_Param.

Within 02_Param:

  cp ../01_Xray/3H9F_prep_lig.pdb lig.pdb
  
Within lig.pdb, rename resname as MOL. Remove excess waters.
View in VMD or other molecular viewer to check structure.

  antechamber -i lig.pdb -fi pdb -bk MOL -o lig.mol2 -fo mol2 -c bcc
  parmchk2 -i lig.mol2 -f mol2 -o lig.frcmod
  
  tleap
  source leaprc.gaff
  MOL = loadmol2 lig.mol2
  saveoff MOL lig.lib
  quit
  
Open 01_Xray/3H9F_prep.pdb in VMD. Save structure without hydrogens as 
02_Param/3H9F_noh.pdb. Using the PQR file as a guide, change the 
histidines within the 3H9F_noh.pdb from HIS to HID, HIE, or HIP as
the PQR2PQR server predicted, save as 3H9F_his_fixed.pdb

Rename the ligand residue within 3H9F_his_fixed.pdb to MOL. Add any 
missing TERs between chains or molecules.

Next, run LEAP

  tleap -f prep.leap

Load 3h9f.prmtop and 3h9f.inpcrd into VMD and check their structures.

Copy the resulting 3h9f.prmtop, 3h9f.inpcrd, and 3h9f_after_leap.pdb
files to 03_MinEqu

03_MinEqu
---------
Within the 03_MinEqu directory, run the minimization and equilibration
script:

  python md_min_equil.py

After running for a long time (perhaps few hours), this makes a file 
named "equilibrated.pdb". This file must be imaged with CPPTRAJ:

  cpptraj < image.cpptraj

View equilibrated_imaged.pdb in VMD to check structure.

Copy the resulting 3h9f.prmtop and equilibrated_imaged.pdb files 
to 04_qmrebind.


04_qmrebind
-----------
Activate the QMrebind environment:

  conda activate QMMM

Run QMrebind on this system to reparametrize the partial charges:

  python ~/qmrebind/qmrebind/run_qmrebind_amber.py equilibrated_imaged.pdb 3h9f.prmtop -L MOL -c 5.0 -m MP2 -b "cc-pVTZ" -n 4

Deactivate the QMrebind environment:

  conda deactivate

After this run is completed, the 3h9f.prmtop file within the 
04_qmrebind/work_dir_qmrebind directory is used as input to SEEKR, as
is equilibrated_imaged.pdb.

The ligand.pqr and receptor.pqr files were prepared using ambpdb:

  ambpdb -p 3h9f.prmtop -c 3h9f.inpcrd -pqr > 3h9f_all.pqr

And then the receptor portion was manually separated from the ligand
portion and placed into different files: "receptor.pqr" and 
"ligand_not_renumbered.pqr". The latter file must be renumbered. A
script within seekrtools automatically does this:

  python ~/seekrtools/seekrtools/scripts/pqr_resid_for_each_atom.py ligand_not_renumbered.pqr ligand.pqr

All files are now present for use to prepare a HIDR/SEEKR calculation.
